Wow, a visitor... What would you like to know?
1.Where am I?
2.What are you?
You are in a scrapyard that was once full of robots.. Although most of them left, we chose to stay and live the rest of our lives here like this.
I was a robot thrown away by the space ship above.. The only one left there now is a shopkeeper robot.
This robot is no longer operating
Hello there! It's been some time since i saw a visitor! I am glad you are here, i have missed talking to someone!
The robot in the shop threw us down here since we were becoming useless.
This place was meant to be a landfill of robots, but mostof them left on their own.
The temple was created by the robot to keep the evil drones in!
