I see you fixed your ship..
1.What can i do now?
2.What else is there for me?
Go back to the temple and collect some alien eggs to sell in the shop and purchase a bomb maybe!
You can go up to the spaceship above by riding in your spaceship!
This robot is no longer operating
Oh, you have fixed your ship!
Then maybe now is a good time to go up to the shop above, if you want to complete what you came here for...
Psst, just get the limited edition bomb that the robot sells. 
Oh, don't mind us, we were fated to die here anyway..
